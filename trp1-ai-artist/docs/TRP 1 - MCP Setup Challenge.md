# **TRP 1 \- MCP Setup Challenge**

## **Overview**

This is a 1-hour MCP setup challenge to verify foundational qualities. The question we're answering: **Do you have** what it takes to configure your coding environment with MCP tools, skills, and rules to ensure a modern code orchestrator environment with AI Agent assistants.

| Competency | What We're Looking For |
| ----- | ----- |
| Technical Comprehension | Can you follow technical instructions and configure MCP Sense (10 Academy MCP server)  correctly? |
| AI Openness & Curiosity | Are you willing to explore AI-powered tooling (Cursor/Antigravity/Warp/Claud Code/VSCode, MCP servers, Skills, Agent rules, Coderabbit, etc.)? |
| Motivation & Hard-Working | Do you show up, put your best effort, engage, and respond to timely communications,   and complete the task provided within the time window? |

## **The Challenge**

### **Task 1: Setup**

Configure your IDE with the Tenx MCP server following the [Tenx MCP Analysis Documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TDX6o2tfgu9PaTRwhNV70wr2s1t1XuIFhoNgBAgBD30/edit?usp=sharing). Choose your preferred IDE (VS Code, Cursor, or Claude Code) and complete the setup steps.

Your Tenx MCP connection must be active throughout the assessment so that your interactions with your coding agent will get logged automatically on our end.

### **Task 2: Research & Configure**

Your coding agent uses a rules file to understand how to work with you effectively. Your task is to improve this rules file by learning from how Boris Cherny, the creator of Claude Code, and others in the community setup their environment, following best practices for controlling and guiding AI agent assistants. It is important that you do broad research and identify what is good practice. Test the AI agent behavior as you update and modify rules and learn the patterns based on the agent and LLM model selected.

**Reference:** [Boris Cherny's workflow thread on X](https://x.com/bcherny/status/2007179832300581177)

**Your rules file location depends on your IDE:**

* **VS Code:** .github/copilot-instructions.md  
* **Cursor:** .cursor/rules/agent.mdc  
* **Claude Code:** CLAUDE.md

Study the reference material carefully and update your rules file with configurations that will make your coding agent more effective.

### **Task 3: Documentation**

Document your work in your GitHub repository in **markdown** files by recording the following:

1. **What you did** \- Describe the changes you made to your rules file  
2. **What worked** \- What configurations or approaches were successful  
3. **What didn't work** \- What challenges did you face, and how did you troubleshoot  
4. **Insights gained** \- how do rules change the behaviour of the AI agent to align with your intent, thought pattern, and expectation.

## **Submission**

1. Your GitHub repository link \- should be **public** so that we can view it. It should contain all artifacts such as   
   1. The final rule you have created \- markdown file  
   2. Report of your activity as per the Documentation guide above. This is especially important when you are unable to connect our MCP server to your IDE as we will know what you tried and your troubleshooting techniques and approach.  
   3. Other document artifacts you have generated over time that show your effort and curiosity  
2. Your Tenx MCP connection must be active throughout the assessment so that your interactions with your coding agent will get logged automatically on our end.
